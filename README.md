# LinkedIn Clone

This is a clone of the LinkedIn social networking service that I have built using React, JavaScript, Node.js, and Firebase, and the Vite build tool.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out using their email and password.

- User profiles: Users can create a profile with their name, photo, and professional experience.

- News feed: Users can view a news feed with posts and updates from other users.

- Post creation: Users can create their own posts and share them with their network.

- Like and comment: Users can like and comment on other users' posts.
